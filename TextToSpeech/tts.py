text = "News content is shaped by its own unique characteristics. Sentences and paragraphs are usually short and highly informative because writers have to compress information into a limited space. Depending on the theme, news articles may contain relevant terminology, place names, abbreviations, peopleâ€™s names, and quotes. Excellent news writing is clear, precise, and avoids ambiguity. The writing is dynamic, especially in online articles, because content may get updated multiple times per day as new information becomes available."
